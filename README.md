# Application of ARIMA predictive models and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for pension forecasting

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Final Degree Project (TFG), titled "Predictive models for the Spanish pension system in the short and medium term". The project aims to forecast the evolution of the Spanish pension system using two main techniques:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A traditional statistical method for time series forecasting.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): A deep learning approach, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture complex temporal dependencies.

Both methods are applied to model and predict the pension system's behavior in the short and medium term, providing insights into its future sustainability.
